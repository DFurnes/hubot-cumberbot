==================

Because your goofy and excited Hubot-based chatbot is a huge fan of the actor Benedict Cumberbatch, but is nearly incapable of spelling his name correctly.

## Installation

Put it in your `scripts` folder, homey.

## Usage

Just invoke the name of Benedict Cumberbatch:

```
Benedict Cumberbatch has amazing range, but I find his eyes just a bit too _piercing_.
```

and quoth the robot:

```
BATHYSPHERE CLAMBAKE!
```

And so it goes. I swear, this can yield hours of entertainment.
